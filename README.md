# Fire Watcher

**Fire Watcher** is an Windows application that shows and predicts fires around the world. The project is built on **Java 1.8** using **JavaFX** and **FXML** for the user interface. 

## How it works

- The data is retrieved in CSV files from NASA's active fire database using API calls.
- It is then parsed so that it can be displayed on Google map within the application.
- Possible fire trajectories are predicted based on weather and wind conditions in specific areas.
